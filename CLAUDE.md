# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A comprehensive automated testing framework for validating critical user experience flows on the Amazon e-commerce platform. This test suite ensures the reliability and functionality of core customer journeys through systematic end-to-end testing using Playwright and pytest.

## Current Test Implementation

The framework currently implements a comprehensive end-to-end test that validates:

### âœ… **Implemented Functionality**
- **Search Functionality**: Product search for "Apple AirPods Max" with intelligent product detection and bot handling
- **Product Selection**: Smart selection of actual Apple AirPods Max products from search results
- **Cart Management**: Add to cart functionality with comprehensive verification and confirmation
- **Advanced Popup Handling**: Multi-layered approach handling iframe, shadow DOM, and forced click scenarios
- **Shopping Cart Operations**: Navigate to shopping cart page and update item quantity to 2
- **Checkout Process**: Navigate to checkout with price validation and authentication handling

### ðŸ”„ **Future Planned Features**
- **Complete Checkout Flow**: Full guest checkout flow with payment validation
- **Advanced Search**: Filters, sorting, and search result accuracy
- **Product Interactions**: Variant selection and product comparisons
- **Payment Validation**: Payment flow validation and order confirmation

## Current Architecture

The codebase currently implements:

### **Actual Structure**
- **Single comprehensive test** (`test_search_simple.py`) covering complete user journey
- **Playwright fixtures** in `conftest.py` for browser and page management
- **Environment configuration** via `.env` file with headed mode as default
- **Robust element detection** with multiple fallback strategies for dynamic Amazon UI
- **Comprehensive validation** at each step of the user workflow

### **Key Implementation Features**
- Direct search URL navigation with bot detection and CAPTCHA handling
- Smart page type detection (standard Amazon vs. sponsored/external pages)
- Intelligent Apple product selection logic from search results
- Advanced popup handling with iframe, shadow DOM, and forced click support
- Multiple fallback selectors for cart buttons and confirmation elements
- Cart navigation and quantity update functionality with multiple UI approaches
- Checkout process with price extraction and authentication handling
- Detailed logging and debugging output for troubleshooting
- Visual verification through headed mode with pause points

## Common Commands

Since this is a Playwright + pytest project, these commands will likely be used:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or
pip install playwright pytest

# Install browser binaries
playwright install

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_search_simple.py

# Run tests with specific markers
pytest -m smoke

# Run tests in headed mode (visible browser)
pytest --headed

# Run tests in parallel
pytest -n auto

# Generate test report
pytest --html=report.html
```

## Development Notes

### **Current Implementation Principles**
- **Defensive Testing**: Multiple fallback strategies for dynamic Amazon UI elements
- **Smart Navigation**: Direct URL approach instead of form interaction for reliability
- **Explicit Waits**: Uses `page.wait_for_selector()` and `page.wait_for_load_state()` appropriately
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Verifies each step with detailed logging output
- **Environment Configuration**: Uses `.env` file for browser settings (headed mode default)

### **Key Technical Approaches**
- **Element Detection**: Multiple selector strategies with graceful fallbacks
- **Bot Detection Handling**: CAPTCHA detection and homepage navigation to avoid bot blocks
- **Advanced Popup Management**: 4-layer approach for popup handling:
  1. Iframe detection and interaction
  2. Main page selector matching
  3. Button text scanning with forced clicks
  4. Shadow DOM element detection
- **Intelligent Product Selection**: Text matching to find actual Apple products vs. alternatives
- **Page Type Recognition**: Distinguishes Amazon product pages from external/sponsored content
- **Cart Verification**: Multiple confirmation methods (UI elements, cart count, success messages)
- **Checkout Integration**: Price extraction, authentication detection, and validation logic
- **Error Handling**: Continues execution with informative error messages rather than failing completely
- **Visual Debugging**: Headed mode with pause points for manual verification

### **Test Execution Patterns**
```bash
# Run the main end-to-end test with full output
pytest tests/test_search_simple.py::TestAmazonSearchSimple::test_search_and_select_second_result -v -s

# Expected output flow:
# Navigating to Amazon homepage...
# CAPTCHA detected - manual intervention required
# Navigating to: https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Apple+AirPods+Max
# Found search results with selector: [data-component-type='s-search-result']
# Found 18 search results
# Looking for Apple AirPods Max results...
# Found Apple AirPods result at index 0
# âœ“ Successfully navigated to product page
# âœ“ Standard Amazon product page detected
# âœ“ Found 'Add to Cart' button with selector: #add-to-cart-button
# âœ“ Clicked 'Add to Cart' button
# âœ“ Cart confirmation found: [data-feature-name='addToCart']
# âœ“ Item successfully added to cart
# Checking for iframes...
# Found 6 frames on page
# âœ“ Protection plan popup handled successfully
# âœ“ Found cart navigation with selector: #nav-cart
# âœ“ Successfully navigated to cart page
# âœ“ Found quantity increase button: button[aria-label*='Increase']
# âœ“ Updated quantity to 2 via plus button
# âœ“ Shopping cart operations completed
# âœ“ Successfully navigated to checkout
# âœ“ Checkout process and validation completed
